# odin-landing-page
the first full page on odin course to make after introducing to html ,css, flexbox . 

this was very fun exprience. at first i thought i should change everything,but decided to not do it ... 
we should be happy with what we achieved now and celebrate it rather than being discourage that it's not fancy enough.
no it should be simple it should encourage more poeple to try it 
with this project i understand i need think more on naming and grouping . there were alot of similar rules i would like combine together
